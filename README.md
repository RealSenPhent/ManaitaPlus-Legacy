# ManaitaPlus Legacy

Manaita Plus is based on a mod called Manaita that once existed on the Minecraft Unofficial Japan Users Forum. the forum itself has been permanently closed due to hacking. However, please remember to respect them. For reference, I've attached an archive of the links where Manaita was once distributed.
